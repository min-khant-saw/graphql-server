# GraphQL Server

This repository contains a GraphQL server implementation built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). It provides a simple yet powerful GraphQL API for interacting with data.

## Features

- **GraphQL API**: Provides a GraphQL endpoint for querying and mutating data.
- **Express.js Integration**: Utilizes Express.js for handling HTTP requests.
- **Modular Structure**: Organized codebase with modular components for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Sample Data**: Includes sample data for testing and development purposes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this GraphQL server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/min-khant-saw/graphql-server.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `cd graphql-server` & `npm install`
3. **Start the Server**: `npm start`
4. **Explore the API**: 
Once the server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:4000/graphql` in your browser to access the GraphQL Playground. From there, you can interact with the API using GraphQL queries and mutations.
